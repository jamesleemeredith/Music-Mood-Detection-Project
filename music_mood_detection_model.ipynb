    "# Music Mood Detection Using Spotify Audio Features\n",

    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this Data Science project was to develop an automated Machine Learning model for detections of a song's dominant mood based on it's audio features. Ultimately the use case for this project would be to pitch a new feature to Spotify where users can say \"Hey Spotify, I'm feeling sad. Play me something sad\" and then spotify would play them a song that's emotion is coded as sad. In terms of the project, ultimately I'm predicting that audio features of a song like it's key, rhythm, etc. will be highly correlated with it's dominant mood, and would be using the various audio features to run a logistic regression and compare it to decision trees. Audio features were derived from the Spotify API, and mood/emotion data was compiled using user-generated tags from Last.FM.\n"

    "## Business Problem\n",
    "\n",
    "Spotify currently offers a robust recommendation system whereby users receive recommendations for music they might like based on their past listening habits. However, Spotify does not currently offer a feature whereby users can request music based on their current mood. The purpose of this project is to develop a model that can predict the dominant mood of a song based on it's audio features, and then to use that model to develop a recommendation system for users to request music based on their current mood.\n",

    "Song data was compiled using a dataset derived from the Spotify API, and included audio features such as track key, loudness, danceability, and valence. Emotion meta-data was compiled using user-generated tags from Last.FM, and then was sorted and aggregated into four broad categories (happy, sad, angry, relaxed). The data was then cleaned and merged into a single dataframe for analysis.\n",

    "Based on the analysis, the author recommends the use of audio feature data to predict the dominant mood of a song. The author also recommends the use of a decision tree model to predict the dominant mood of a song based on it's audio features.
